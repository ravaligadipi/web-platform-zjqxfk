                    By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is
                    delivering on his promise to build an economy that works for
                    working families, including Asian American, Native Hawaiian,
                    and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) families. The Inflation
                    Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care
                    costs, and energy costs. It’s the most aggressive action we
                    have taken to confront the climate crisis. It’ll lower the
                    deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay
                    their fair share. And no one making under $400,000 per year
                    will pay a penny more in taxes.<br /><br />President Biden
                    and Congressional Democrats beat back the special interests
                    to pass this historic legislation that lowers costs for
                    Americans and their families, advances environmental justice
                    while building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from
                    the bottom up and the middle out.<br /><strong

                    ><br />The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health
                    care costs, including prescription drug costs, and expand
                    health insurance coverage for AA and NHPI families.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong

                    Since President Biden took office, the uninsured rate has
                    reached a new historic low: 8% and over 5 million Americans
                    have gained health insurance coverage. The Inflation

                    <strong>Lower Costs for Small Businesses: </strong>According

                    revenues and create 3.6 million jobs. The Inflation

                      power – lowering operating costs and protecting against

                    <strong><u>MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</u></strong
                    ><br />President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017
                    tax law only made an unfair tax system worse. The Inflation
                    Reduction Act of 2022 is a critical step forward in making
                    our tax code fairer. It will raise revenue by:

                      currently get away with paying no federal income tax.

                      Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that

                    The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to
                    finance critically needed investments to lower costs and
                    combat climate change, they are also an important component
                    of building an economy that rewards work rather than wealth
                    and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away with playing
                    by a separate set of rules.&nbsp;<br /><br />Millions of
                    working families will have better access to the benefits
                    they are entitled to under the tax code and be able to get
                    their questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to
                    the Act’s transformational investments in the Internal
                    Revenue Service. And, no family making less than $400,000
                    per year will see their taxes go up by a single cent.&nbsp;
